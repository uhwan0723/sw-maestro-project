"""Stub sub-graphs + selector.

Each agent owner exports a compiled LangGraph sub-graph. All agent code
lives under repo root ``agents/<name>/`` (see ``08-roles-and-handoffs.md`` §3.3):

- ``agents.vision`` — Vision Agent (``vision_subgraph``, ``analyze_outfit``)
- ``agents.recommendation`` — Recommendation Agent (``recommendation_subgraph``)
- Context Agent — not yet implemented; always falls through to the stub.

If the real module isn't importable (deps not installed, code not yet
merged, etc.) ``get_subgraphs()`` falls back to a schema-valid stub so
the super-graph still runs end-to-end. Each call re-evaluates so test
suites can monkey-patch imports between runs.
